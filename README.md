# deep_learning_papers

This is mostly my reading dump. They are too deep to post at
[[AIDL](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DeepNetGroup/)], but it's
interesting enough for me to take some notes.  Putting all notes
at git is a habit I learned from [Denny Britz](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes).
